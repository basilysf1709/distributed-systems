# Ch2: Super concise sumamry
- Data Models have a profound effect no how a system is built
- Popular Data Models include:
  - **SQL**
    - Relational
    - Hide implementation detail behind a cleaner interface
  - **NoSQL**
    - Non-relational
    - Document stores, Wide Column, Graph, etc
    - People were frustrated with the restriveness of relational model
    - There was a need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, includ‚Äê
ing very large datasets or **very high write throughput**
- Some data requirements are better suited for JSON document stores
  - One-to-many
    - Usually requires joins or complicated queries
    - With something like MongoDB, it can be easily queried once and you get the data
  - Sometimes other relationships like many-to-one and many-to-many are better suited for SQL Databases because **joins** (SQL) are usually easier than **multiple querying** (Document Stores)
- Historical debate between the network model and the SQL model
- Query Optimizer made SQL models **general purpose** (query your data in the way you want to)
- Arguments for SQL:
  - easier to do joins on **relational** data
- Arguments for Document Stores:
  - better performance due to data **locality** (related data is usually close to each other
  - flexibility
- Document stores have **schema-on-read** whereas SQL databases have **schema-on-write**
- Data locality for queries
   - Document models better if you frequently need entire document
   - Less effective if you often access only parts of document
- Convergence of document and relational databases
   - Document databases adding join support
   - Relational databases supporting JSON
- Query Languages
   - Declarative vs Imperative
      - SQL is declarative
      - Imperative languages describe how to perform specific operations
- MapReduce Querying
   - Used for processing large amounts of data across many machines
   - Map: Transforms input data
   - Reduce: Aggregates data
   - Must be pure functions without side effects

- Graph-Like Data Models
   - Vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships)
   - Use cases: social networks, web graphs, road networks
   - Property graph model
      - Used by Neo4j, Titan, InfiniteGraph
   - Triple-store model
      - Used by AllegroGraph, Datomic
- Graph Query Languages
   - Cypher: for property graphs (Neo4j)
   - SPARQL: for RDF triple-stores
   - Datalog: older, used in Cascalog for Hadoop
- Graph vs Relational Databases
   - Graphs better for flexible, unpredictable relationships
   - Relational better when relationships are known in advance
- Graph vs Document Databases
   - Documents: self-contained data, rare relationships
   - Graphs: anything potentially related to anything
- Semantic Web
   - Aim: machine-readable information on websites
   - Uses Resource Description Framework (RDF)
   - Limited practical implementation
